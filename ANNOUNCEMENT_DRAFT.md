**Headline:** ✨ Announcing `python-oephys` v0.1.0: Streamlining Real-Time Electrophysiology! ✨

I’m thrilled to release `python-oephys`, a comprehensive open-source Python toolkit for the [Open Ephys](https://open-ephys.org/) ecosystem. 🦾🧠

Working with high-density neural data shouldn't mean spending weeks on boilerplate I/O. We’ve built this to bridge the gap between acquisition and real-time inference.

**What's inside?**
- 🔴 **Seamless ZMQ Streaming**: Live acquisition directly from the Open Ephys GUI.
- 🎛️ **High-Performance Processing**: Optimized filters and automated signal quality (QC) checks.
- 🤖 **End-to-End ML**: Hybrid CNN-LSTM models for real-time gesture recognition.
- 📊 **Interactive Tooling**: Real-time plots and desktop applications for trial segmentation.

Whether you're building closed-loop systems or performing deep offline analysis, `python-oephys` provides the unified high-performance foundation you need.

🚀 **Get started:** `pip install python-oephys`
💻 **Code & Examples:** [https://github.com/Neuro-Mechatronics-Interfaces/python-open-ephys]

A big thank you to the Neuromechatronics Lab at Carnegie Mellon University for the support in bringing this release to life!

## Tips for your post:
1. **The Visual is Key**: Record a 15-second screen capture of the `RealTimeEMGViewer` running. It makes the project feel "real" and interactive.
2. **Tag the Lab**: Tag the Neuromechatronics Lab page and any core collaborators like Max Murphy or Adrian Foy.
3. **The First Comment**: LinkedIn loves engagement. Post the link to the GitHub repo in the *first comment* instead of the post body to maximize algorithm reach.
